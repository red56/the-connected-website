			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This commentary on the journal <a href="http://www.fourthdoor.co.uk/">Fourth Door Review</a> will be published sometime in some form in the magazine <a href="http://www.buildingforafuture.co.uk/">Green Building</a>.</p>
<p>Review of Fourth Door Review</p>
<p>        The Fourth Door Review is a very curious publication. It engages<br />
thoughtfully with content that ranges from technology and new media to<br />
holistic ecological theory, yet whilst it focuses in particular on<br />
architecture and design, art and music - each issue typically include<br />
a few random entries as well - there is a recipe for carrot soup in<br />
this issue, for example. There is however, a pattern that connects the<br />
entries, and in a marketplace saturated with safe approaches to<br />
journalism, FDR is neither the woolly sub-phenomenological babble that<br />
can too often characterise attempts at ecological holistic writing,<br />
nor is it the glossy techno-worship that is frequently pushed at<br />
visually vulnerable design students. It occupies rather, a<br />
productively unstable and hybrid modern position, which can perhaps<br />
ultimately be understood as contributing to a new interpretation of<br />
the architectural historian Kenneth Frampton&#8217;s theory of Critical<br />
Regionalism?<br />
        The Fourth Door Review is published on a highly irregular basis - the<br />
latest, number eight, is the first for several years - and its<br />
editorial seems to enjoy the fact that the arrival of issues is<br />
becoming even less predicable! However, as soon as one starts to read<br />
the publication, one can begin to understand why that might be.<br />
Firstly, it is very beautifully produced - neither a book nor a<br />
magazine - it is more like a lovingly crafted journal or notebook. The<br />
content further supports such a diaristic interpretation: whilst there<br />
are contributions from several different authors, the majority of the<br />
material is developed out of a series of conversations between Oliver<br />
Lowenstein - the journals founder and editorial co-ordinator - and<br />
various artists, practitioners and thinkers. Whilst this unusual<br />
editorial balance could be seen as a weakness in the journal, it<br />
actually becomes a strength and defining characteristic. Indeed, in so<br />
far as the substance of the Fourth Door Review is largely interview<br />
based, it is perhaps best understood as working within the tradition<br />
of a literary form that would include Fritof Capra&#8217;s Conversations<br />
with Remarkable People, and even G.I. Gurdjieff&#8217;s Meetings with<br />
Remarkable Men. Lowenstein is an independent academic and researcher,<br />
and his projects and travels feed into and determine the direction of<br />
each issue. His recent projects have included a proposal for a chain<br />
of bicycle stations, and curating a exhibition exploring the cultural<br />
use of wood in Scottish architecture, and the research generated for<br />
latter of these projects in particular has found expression in the<br />
current issue.<br />
        The FDR is then primarily a series of collaborative, even co-designed<br />
texts: dialogues  fleshed out where necessary with further stories,<br />
anecdotes and facts. Their success is based upon the real quality of<br />
the individuals that Lowenstein engages with. In the latest issue, we<br />
meet architectural thinkers and practitioners of global significance,<br />
such as Peter Zumthor and Juhani Palasmaa, in substantial<br />
conversations that provide new insights to their work, thereby making<br />
a real contribution to the academic material on these thinkers.<br />
Operating at a similar level of cultural recognition are several of<br />
the musicians whose work is explored. David Sylvan&#8217;s seminal works in<br />
the eighties and nineties inspired many other more commercial groups,<br />
and defined much of the sound of that period, whilst Jen Finer was a<br />
guitarist (and more) with The Pogues. Sylvan - in a revealing and<br />
personal dialogue - discusses recent developments in his recorded<br />
music. Moving in a very different direction, Jen Finer discusses<br />
both his millennial 1000 year duration Long Player, and more recent<br />
though equally experimental acoustic-landscape art hybrids.<br />
        In summary, it is perhaps the range of material touched upon, that<br />
makes FDR a dialogue worth eavesdropping on. In this issue, one finds<br />
references to the CERN collider a few pages away from Stewart Brand&#8217;s<br />
Long Now Foundation, Goethean Science based studies of flow near<br />
internet based community mapping experiments. We find Passivhaus<br />
pioneers next to the digitally fabricated patterned brickwork of ETH<br />
Zurich&#8217;s Gramazio and Kohler, and references to Paul Virilio&#8217;s Grey<br />
Ecology not far from a review of a Mongolian music festival. As<br />
Lowenstein comments whilst deep in his Swiss travels, &#8220;I felt that I<br />
was in the presence of a new hybrid, machine augmented to be sure,<br />
though also within the bounds of craft, even if it was very definitely<br />
another kind of craft, another way of making.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jon Goodbun (jon@wag-architecture.co.uk) was a founding partner of<br />
architecture and design group WAG (www.wag-architecture.co.uk), and<br />
contributes to the Polytechnic research group (www.thepolytechnic.org)<br />
at University of Westminster, where he will shortly be submitting his<br />
PhD thesis Ecological Cybernetics: Architecture and the Extended Mind</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>James Lovelock&#8217;s prediction that the environment is past the tipping point, and that the human population will have collapsed by 80% by 2100 look increasingly likely to be accurate, given the data in a new report from <a href="http://globalchange.mit.edu/">MIT&#8217;s Centre for Global Change Science</a> based on their Integrated Global System Model.</p>
<p>Their model, which is unique in that it incorporates data on human-activity—such as economic growth and energy use—as well as analyzing atmospheric, oceanic, and biological systems, suggests that global warming is likely to be twice as severe as previously thought. Their analysis is based upon running multiple scenario variations, giving probabilities of possible outcomes. After 400 runs, their model suggests that there is a 90 percent probability that temperatures will have risen 3.5 to 7.4 degrees Celsius by the end of the century. Their models suggest a very low probability of less than two degrees warming, which is generally agreed to be the point at which runaway warming starts due to positive feedback from various sources (such as reduction in albido and methane release.) These kinds of temperature changes are widely agreed to mean the catastrophic collapse of planetary ecosystems, and the total breakdown of current social and economic structures: see for example the <a href="http://www.stockholm-network.org/Conferences-and-Programmes/Energy-and-Environment/carbonscenarios">Stockholm Networks Report.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;There is significantly more risk than we previously estimated,&#8221; according to Ronald Prinn, the co-director of the program. &#8220;This increases the urgency for significant policy action. There&#8217;s no way the world can or should take these risks.” </p>
<p>The latest article is available here (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2009JCLI2863.1">http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/2009JCLI2863.1</a>), although this journal does not have Athens login. An older version can be downloaded here: <a href="http://globalchange.mit.edu/files/document/MITJPSPGC_Rpt169.pdf">http://globalchange.mit.edu/files/document/MITJPSPGC_Rpt169.pdf</a></p>
<p>The report abstract is below:</p>
<p><a href="http://wag.myzen.co.uk/thepolytechnic/wp-content/files/2009/05/diagram-igsm-chart.jpg" onclick="window.open('http://wag.myzen.co.uk/thepolytechnic/wp-content/files/2009/05/diagram-igsm-chart.jpg','popup','width=622,height=504,scrollbars=no,resizable=yes,toolbar=no,directories=no,location=no,menubar=no,status=yes,left=0,top=0');return false"><img src="http://wag.myzen.co.uk/thepolytechnic/wp-content/files/2009/05/diagram-igsm-chart-tm.jpg" height="364" width="450" border="1" hspace="4" vspace="4" alt="diagram-igsm-chart" title="diagram-igsm-chart" /></a></p>
<p>The MIT Integrated Global System Model is used to make probabilistic projections of climate change from 1861 to 2100. Since the model&#8217;s first projections were published in 2003 substantial improvements have been made to the model and improved estimates of the probability distributions of uncertain input parameters have become available. The new projections are considerably warmer than the 2003 projections, e.g., the median surface warming in 2091 to 2100 is 5.2°C compared to 2.4°C in the earlier study. Many changes contribute to the stronger warming; among the more important ones are taking into account the cooling in the second half of the 20th century due to volcanic eruptions for input parameter estimation and a more sophisticated method for projecting GDP growth which eliminated many low emission scenarios. However, if recently published data, suggesting stronger 20th century ocean warming, are used to determine the input climate parameters, the median projected warning at the end of the 21st century is only 4.1°C. Nevertheless all our simulations have a much smaller probability of warming less than 2.4°C, than implied by the lower bound of the IPCC AR4 projected likely range for the A1FI scenario, which has forcing very similar to our median projection. The probability distribution for the surface warming produced by our analysis is more symmetric than the distribution assumed by the IPCC due to a different feedback between the climate and the carbon cycle, resulting from the inclusion in our model of the carbon-nitrogen interaction in the terrestrial ecosystem.</p>

It is said that:</p>
<p>Alex Schramm is an investigative and vigorous tinkerer whose work may be seen in the context of Sci-Fi Historicism.<br />
He has evolved a structuralist approach to anthropomorphic movements, achieving an invigorating beauty with<br />
meticulous finishes that overshadow a quite technical approach. He fuses linguistic and mechanical ready-mades into<br />
characters with a kind of visual consistency never seen before.<br />
The quality of his work is reminiscent of drawings by Francis Bacon, Leonardo da Vinci, Max Ernst and the writings<br />
by Alfred Jarry, Lewis Carroll and Rabelais.<br />
Alex Schramm currently lives and works as artist and architect in London.

<p>THEME:<br />
The notion of transparency has achieved a continued, if varied, currency in<br />
architectural discourse throughout the twentieth-century. Along with a<br />
multitude of material attributes, transparency advocates a shifting, yet<br />
ever-present, ideological sensibility. Towards the latter part of the<br />
twentieth-century, however, the general notion of transparency as an<br />
ideological mechanism began to decline. Today, while a literal sense of<br />
transparency remains, seemingly its ideology does not. This symposium aims<br />
to resurface the question of ideology in (contemporary) architectural<br />
discourse by creating dialogues around the following questions:<br />
_ As the notion of transparency appears to be superseded by the<br />
immateriality of the digital, how can contemporary architectural research<br />
address transparency’s role as a technological innovation, as a mechanism<br />
for design, and, above all, as an ideological device?<br />
_ Do new design technologies and media produce more transparent systems of<br />
communication?<br />
_ Despite the apparent displacement of ideology in current architectural<br />
arguments and projects, what are the subjacent ideologies that remain and<br />
how might we be able to scrutinise them?</p>

<p>“Proposals for the establishment of a college of architecture and building as part of a scheme for the reorganisation of Regent Street Polytechnic…we have approved in principle proposals for the transformation of the Polytechnic into a federal institution, composed of three colleges, namely a college of architecture and advanced building studies, a college of engineering and science, and a college of commerce… Each of the three constituent colleges would have the fullest possible measure of independence and would, it is hoped, attract principles and staff of high quality.”</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Message forwarded from Climate Camp Facebook group - please circulate:</p>
<p>The G20 Swoop &#038; crucial information for the Climate Camp in the City of London!</p>
<p>April 1st is only a few days away! Below is the crucial information you will need for camping in the square mile during the G20.</p>
<p>Please forward this to your friends, any groups you are a part of, and post it on websites. Check out http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http://www.climatecamp.org.uk%2Fg20 for updates.</p>
<p>(1) THE SWOOP &#038; OVER-POLICING<br />
(2) TEXT ALERTS &#038; COMMUNICATION<br />
(3) THE MAP<br />
(4) INFOPOINTS &#038; BRIEFINGS<br />
(5) SLEEPING SPACE<br />
(6) THINGS TO BRING<br />
(7) AUTONOMOUS ACTIONS &#038; MEDIA<br />
(8) LEGAL<br />
(9) WORKSHOPS &#038; CEILIDH<br />
(10) PUT PEOPLE FIRST MARCH<br />
(11) IT&#8217;S A NUMBERS GAME</p>
<p>(1) THE SWOOP &#038; OVER-POLICING</p>
<p>To be successful, we must all arrive at the Climate Exchange at the same<br />
time. We must swoop in from different directions, using different means to<br />
arrive within a minute or two of each other. Its a good idea to meet up<br />
with your friends early, and somewhere within easy reach of the Climate<br />
Exchange. Then, at the appropriate moment, leave quickly, to arrive at<br />
exactly 12:30. You may even want to practice beforehand.</p>
<p>Be aware that in light of current over-policing tactics, if you miss the<br />
swoop, you may be unable to join the camp. In places where our numbers are<br />
too low, the police may attempt to stop and search individuals, and<br />
confiscate items to prevent us from setting up the camp safely. We can<br />
avoid this by moving confidently and together.  The police may also<br />
attempt to surround people to prevent us from moving (sometimes called a<br />
&#8220;kettle&#8221;).  Nearby tube stations, particularly Liverpool Station, as well<br />
as the Bank (where the G20-meltdown protest is occurring at noon), are<br />
possible locations where the police may try to kettle people.  If you see<br />
a kettle forming and don&#8217;t want to be stuck for the day in one, move and<br />
help others move out of it before it closes.</p>
<p>You are likely to have greater freedom of movement if you&#8217;ve planned your<br />
swoop and know the area.  Because things may change on the day, please<br />
take copies of our map with grid reference points, and have a person in<br />
your group subscribed to the text alerts.</p>
<p>(2) TEXT ALERTS &#038; COMMUNICATION</p>
<p>Things may change on the day, perhaps significantly. There is a text<br />
message news service which will be available in advance and during the G20<br />
Leaders meeting. We strongly recommend that people subscribe to it. It is<br />
possible, even likely, that the place that we finally set up camp will not<br />
be the Climate Exchange.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http://www.climatecamp.org.uk%2Fg20/text-updates">http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http://www.climatecamp.org.uk%2Fg20/text-updates</a></p>
<p>We also use Twitter <a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http://twitter.com%2FClimateCamp">http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http://twitter.com%2FClimateCamp</a> but please note that<br />
twitter does not reach mobile phone numbers and is now a web-service, so<br />
on the day this will only be useful for those with web-enabled phones or<br />
those with friends at home ready to call.</p>
<p>You may want to also exchange phone numbers with your friends and people<br />
in other groups so that our communication network is as decentralised as<br />
possible.</p>
<p>(3) THE MAP</p>
<p>A map of the city, with grid reference points will be released at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http://www.climatecamp.org.uk%2Fg20/map">http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http://www.climatecamp.org.uk%2Fg20/map</a><br />
 in the coming days.  Please print copies for you and your friends.  It will be used on the day when the text<br />
alert gives the location of the camp, or any other information throughout the day.</p>
<p>Various carbon off-set companies, carbon trading firms, greenwashing<br />
firms, and other climate-criminals will also be highlighted on the map.<br />
If the police prevent us from safely setting up the camp, groups are<br />
especially encouraged to do an action at one of these locations, or any<br />
other location they have researched. It can also aid communication between<br />
you and your mates. Losing your friends in a crowd really sucks!</p>
<p>(4) INFOPOINTS &#038; BRIEFINGS</p>
<p>From Thursday March 26th until Thursday April 2nd rampARTS will be a G20<br />
infopoint, open to drop by from 2-10 pm.  The Camp for Climate Action will<br />
have information there during this period.</p>
<p>On Saturday March 28th at 5 pm, and on Sunday March 29th at 2 pm, the camp<br />
will be serving tea and cake for those who want to meet up and share<br />
information, or make some banners and props.</p>
<p>On Tuesday March 31st at 7 pm, there will be a briefing at rampART, with a<br />
particular focus on new people who need information about the April 1st<br />
camp.</p>
<p>RampART is located at 15 -17 Rampart Street, London E1 2LA (near<br />
Whitechapel, off Commercial Rd).  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http://rampart%5Bat%5Dmutualaid.org%2C  07050 618445"http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http://rampart%5Bat%5Dmutualaid.org%2C  07050 618445</a></p>
<p></a><a href="hhttp://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http://therampart.wordpress.com%2Flocation-contact%2F"http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http://therampart.wordpress.com%2Flocation-contact%2F</a></p>
<p>(5) SLEEPING SPACE</p>
<p>If you are coming from out of town, places are available to stay! Please<br />
contact us early so that we can reserve you a place. Email<br />
iwanttocrashinasquatfortheg20@hushmail.com to let them know how many<br />
people will be staying, and the dates you need.</p>
<p>(6) THINGS TO BRING</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re staying for the full 24 hours, please check out<br />
</a><a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http://www.climatecamp.org.uk%2Fg20/what-to-bring"http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http://www.climatecamp.org.uk%2Fg20/what-to-bring</a> for what to bring.</p>
<p>(7) AUTONOMOUS ACTIONS AND MEDIA</p>
<p>Are you planning an autonomous action and would you like to try and get<br />
media there as soon as it happens? You can chat to the climate camp media<br />
crew about it beforehand who can point the media your way, or can help you<br />
get your press release out. You don&#8217;t have to give them the details<br />
beforehand, but do get in touch with press@climatecamp.org.uk or call<br />
07040 900905 to arrange something.</p>
<p>(8) LEGAL</p>
<p>Our legal team have prepared a handy crib sheet of information about your<br />
legal rights and what to do if something goes wrong. These will be handed<br />
out on the day, but there&#8217;s no guarantee you&#8217;ll get one before<br />
encountering the police, so we advise you to print a copy to bring along.<br />
Check it out at </a><a href="http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http://www.climatecamp.org.uk%2Fg20/legal"http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http://www.climatecamp.org.uk%2Fg20/legal</a></p>
<p>(9) WORKSHOPS &#038; CEILIDH</p>
<p>Workshops and music are on! Workshops will include: Trading our way into<br />
trouble, the Fossil Fuel Economy, A history of Direct Action, Techno<br />
fixes, Transition to a low carbon economy, the latest climate science from<br />
Copenhagen, Mobilising for Copenhagen, Debt and Climate Change, Carbon<br />
Trading and Copenhagen, Sustainable Activism, Samba, Poetry vs Climate<br />

<p>We also need more musicians to play at the ceilidh. More musicians and<br />
sound systems are welcome!</p>
<p>(10) PUT PEOPLE FIRST MARCH AND LEAFLETING</p>
<p>A Camp for Climate Action block for the Put People First March on Saturday<br />
the 28th of March will be meeting at 11 am outside Charing Cross National<br />
Rail Station, on the strand.  We need help handing out leaflets during the<br />
march.  07534 598733 for more info.</p>
<p>(11) IT&#8217;S A NUMBERS GAME</p>
<p>The only way we can win this is through a mass mobilisation of people.<br />
With a week to go we can still get people to join us for the camp. Talk to<br />
your friends and bring them along; change your status and profile picture<br />
on social networks, and invite your contacts to our facebook event </a><a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=49600653225"http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=49600653225</a></p>
<p>. On the day, make sure<br />
you let the people back home know how the camp is going, and how they can<br />
disseminate our message. If each of us brings someone along, we double our<br />
numbers and our strength.</a>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Saturday 7th March the Barbican centre in London hosted a series of events and concerts based around the work of Iannis Xenakis. A timely complement to the current Le Corbusier exhibition at the Barbican art gallery, the evening concert included a performance of  Metastaseis, the third movement of Anastenaria (1953). Based on ruled surfaces in the form of continuous glissandi, Xenakis’ composition was arrived at using drawings and graphs.</p>
<p><img title="Metastasis" alt="Metastasis" src="http://wag.myzen.co.uk/thepolytechnic/wp-content/files/2009/03/metastasis.jpg" /></p>
<p>(Iannis Xenakis, ruled surfaces of sound in Metastasis, 1954)</p>
<p>Working in Corbusier’s office Xenakis had been responsible for amongst other things, the undulating glazed panels at La Tourette – based on proportions derived from Corbusier’s modulor.</p>
<p>See Robin Evans, The Projective Cast, (MIT Press, 1995), pp.295-301):</p>
<p>“The reason he had borrowed the Modulor was because.. it exploited a rare equivalence between a geometric series and an additive series. He was searching for some measure of unity in his musical notation, and was bothered by the irrelation between the geometric progression that defined the pitches of notes in the 12-tone scale, and the additive properties that conventionally pertain between note lengths and bar lengths. So he devised his own musical Fibonacci series to articulate the percussion and the string episodes in Metastasis.”</p>
<p>The concert, which was broadcast on BBC Radio 3 in ‘Performance on 3’ (Tuesday 10 March 2009) is currently still available on the BBC iPlayer:</p>
